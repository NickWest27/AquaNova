        <p>Welcome onboard Captain. I trust you have settling in well. This is your digital logbook where you can record your mission progress, discoveries, and any important notes. Please ensure to keep it updated regularly. I must apologize for the haste, but it is of utmost importance that you get Aqua Nova out of dry dock and underway for sea trials. You and the crew need to get yourselves familiarized with the ships operation and systems under various conditions.</p>

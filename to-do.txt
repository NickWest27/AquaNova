Claude and I can use this to keep notes on what we are woring on (to-do) and issues (bugs).
Items can be marked as complete or resolved. This document should be constantly updated.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Bridge to-dos:
Correct styling of station buttons in left-console to be more centered and not to the right.
Increase readability of all button labels. font size, padding or border is making text small compared to button size.

Big jobs:
Implement correct lat/lon grid using ship state to display on navigation pages.
Implement the upper-display. A context sensitive display to give updates on events. Eg. Ships state (Speed, track, depth), incomming communication alerts, approaching sea floor, etc.
Implement the main-screen. A situation display. 
  -left 30% show summary of whats going on around you so Communication and sensors summary.
  -center 60% shows big picture, so situation view (PLAN view), or communication message, or forward synthetic vision.
  -right 30% show summary of whats going on on the ship, so engineering, and ship state summary.

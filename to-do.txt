1.  Change info displays (splashscreens) do that title is one font, and data is another. 
    This might help show the difference between static and dynamic data.
2. Change aspect ratio of bridgeFrame.png to fit displays.
3. Load bridgeFrame.png in the .css to avoid browser incompatibility.
4. Edit bridge.css to ensure bridgeFrame aspect is maintained, keep background-size: contain and put elements inside a positioned overlay locked to the same size as the scaled frame, not to the screen. Center the overlay and background in the screen so they match. I could temporarily place corner frames to ensure placement.

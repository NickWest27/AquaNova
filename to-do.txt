Claude and I can use this to keep notes on what we are woring on (to-do) and issues (bugs).
Items can be marked as complete or resolved. This document should be constantly updated.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Overall to-dos:
Ensure initialization, loading, saving and reverting is still working correctly via logbooks.
Ensure reverting to a logbook entry correctly reverts the ship state and removes future logbook entries.
Ensure ship state is being correctly used as the single source of truth.
Ensure other all other UI pages, systems, utils, etc are correctly pulling and pushing data to ship state.

Bridge to-dos:
Correct styling of station buttons in left-console to be more centeredand not to the right.
Increase readability of all button labels. font size, padding or border is making text small compared to button size.
Ensure ship state and bridge interact correctly. Ship state is the source of truth.
Ensure ship state is updating the brige and changes at the bridge then update the ship state so other systems like navComputer are working with correct data. 
Ensure that a change at the helmPage, update navComputer via ship state.
Ensure navComputer shows changes in state. eg, see track change on compass.


NavComputer to-dos:
Remove small white dot at ship position.
Remove "navigationReadouts".  
Make an info box in the top left that is hidden until relevan. It's a basic 3 line data box that is context sensitive. eg, a waypoint is selected, show name, bearing, distance.  
Correct "fullBearingLines()", currently they are only drawn to the left.

Big jobs:
Implement correct lat/lon grid using ship state to display on navigation pages.
Implement the upper-display. A context sensitive display to give updates on events. Eg. Ships state (Speed, track, depth), incomming communication alerts, approaching sea floor, etc.
Implement the main-screen. A situation display. 
  -left 30% show summary of whats going on around you so Communication and sensors summary.
  -center 60% shows big picture, so situation view (PLAN view), or communication message, or forward synthetic vision.
  -right 30% show summary of whats going on on the ship, so engineering, and ship state summary.
